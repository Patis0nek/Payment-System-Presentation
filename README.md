# Payment System Presentation
The Payment System Presentation is one of the first projects I created. It serves as a website presentation for my entrepreneurship classes, showcasing a payment system concept. The website incorporates various JavaScript effects to create an engaging and interactive experience for viewers. The project utilizes JavaScript, Popper, and Plotly to implement the desired functionalities.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to present a conceptual payment system design to demonstrate the application of entrepreneurial ideas. The website showcases the features, benefits, and user experience of the payment system concept.
